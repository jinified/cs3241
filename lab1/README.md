Primtives and Transformation:
- GL_POINT, GL_POLYGON
- simple pillar shapes
- glRotateF
- glTranslateF

Coolest thing:
- Usage of GL_BLEND allows more interesting color and pattern
- Usage of GL_LIGHT to add two light sources which changes color of the object when rotated
- Usage of GL_LINE_STIPPLE to create line patterns
